   <h1>How to Clean Your Electric Shaver:</h1>
	<h3>Daily Cleaning (after each use):</h3>
	  <ol>
	    <li> Turn off the shaver and unplug it (if corded).</li>
	    <li>Open the shaving head or foil and remove trapped hair using a small cleaning brush (often provided).</li>
	    <li>If the shaver is waterproof, rinse the head under running water. Use mild soap for deeper cleaning.</li>
	    <li>Shake off the excess water and let it air dry before reassembling.</li>	  
	  </ol>
	
	<h3>Weekly Maintenance:</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Lubricate the blades with a drop of shaver oil to reduce friction and wear.</li>
	    <li>Disassemble the cutting elements and clean inside the head housing for thorough maintenance.</li>
	  </ul>
	
	<h3>Monthly or Deep Cleaning:</h3>	
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use a specialized shaver cleaning solution or system (if provided with the shaver model).</li>
		<li>Replace worn-out blades, foils, or cutters as recommended by the manufacturer (typically every 12-18 months).</li>
	  </ul>
