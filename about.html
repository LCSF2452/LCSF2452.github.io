	<h2>Our Story</h2>
	  <p>Founded in 2019, I found that trying to find shavers that worked for me and my family 
	  was hard with so many options. Our journey started with the idea of finding out if there 
	  is a difference between named brands and generic electric shavers. This question sparked 
	  our mission to give others a chance to find an electric shaver that works for them.</p>
